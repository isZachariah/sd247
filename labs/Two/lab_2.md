# Lab Two

1. Write a program that prompts a user for input of an integer and store is as an int. Invert all the bits in the value and store the result. Output the original value, the inverted value and the inverted value + 1, each in hexadecimal representation and on one line.
   - On the next line, output the same numbers in decimal representation. This should be formatted like table.
   - All hexadecimal numbers should be output with leading zeros so eight hexadecimal digits always appear.
2. Write a program that will read four characters from the keyboard and pack them into a single integer variable. Display the value as hexadecimal. Unpack the four bytes of the variable and output them in reverse order, with the low order byte first.
3. Write a half adder in c/c++ to sum to ints. This should sum and carry. Use only bitwise operators. Explain in the notes why this works, please be detailed as possible. Include a truth table.
4. Write a full adder in c/c++. Use only bitwise operators. Explain in the notes why this works, please be detailed as possible. Include a truth table. 
5. Write a multiplication program that only uses bitwise operators. Explain in the notes why this works, please be detailed as possible.
