/* Area of a Circle
 * Write a program that will compute the area of a circle.
 * The program should prompt for the radius of the circle.
 * It should then display the result. */

/* Precision Area of a Circle
 * Write another version of the first program.
 * Write a program that will compute the area of a circle.
 * The program should prompt for the radius of the circle and the precision of the answer.
 * It should then display the result.
 * You will likely want to switch data types.
 * You will need a highly precise version of pi. 3.141592653589793238 may work. */
