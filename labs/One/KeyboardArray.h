/* Write a program that reads an array size from the keyboard and dynamically allocates an array of that size for floating-point values.
 * Using pointer notation, initialize all the elements of the array so that the value is the index position n, 1/(n+1)^2.
 * Calculate the sum of the elements using array notation, and then output the square root of that sum.
