Final Project (Due Mar 17):
We are going to make a Pomodoro Timer. A pomodoro timer sets 25 minute study periods and 5 minute break periods afterwards.

The pomodoro timer should be turned on/reset by using a switch.
It should give you some visual feedback about how far you are currently through your 25 minutes session. This can should use some combination of  LED Bar, LEDs, RGB LEDs and Pulse-Width Modulation to mimic brightness.
Use some kind of audio sensor (passive or active buzzers) to communicate when the 25 minute session is done and when the 5 minute break is done.
Extra Credit
Start and stop the timer via wifi (check out chapters 12 - 14 in the tutorial)
Use some of the sensors from the bigger kits:
Servo
LED Matrix
LCD Display
Or anything else you can think of!
